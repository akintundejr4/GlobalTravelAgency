# GlobalTravelAgency


Personal project website for a created fictional travel agency. 

Created really to utlize aspects of JQuery and JavaScript that I had not applied to an actual project before. I also really wanted to use the full screen background image idea in a website, as it is something I hope to be using more often in the future. 

The site is really image and CSS animation heavy. Utlizes Boostrap, HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery and CSS style sheets pulled from W3Schools.
