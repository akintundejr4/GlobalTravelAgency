# GlobalTravelAgency


A basic html/css/js website for a fictional travel agency. 

Created to utlize aspects of JQuery and JavaScript that I hadn't used before. I also wanted to try the full screen background image for a wesbite with functionality. 

Utlizes Bootstrap, HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery and CSS style sheets pulled from W3Schools.
